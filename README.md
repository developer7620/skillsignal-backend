SkillSignal — Evidence-Based Skill Verification Engine

SkillSignal is a backend system that evaluates the credibility of developer skill claims using public GitHub data.

Instead of trusting resumes, SkillSignal analyzes repository alignment, contribution depth, activity consistency, and ownership signals to generate a deterministic, explainable confidence score for each claimed skill.
